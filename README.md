This is a simple application that allows a user to sign in an retrieve data from a Netatmo weather station.

It uses Netatmo API that can be found on Netatmo dev [website](https://dev.netatmo.com/apidocumentation/weather).

Currently it writes the outdoor and indoor temparature to a file, but could be easily adapted to suit any need.
